A factorial is a mathematical operation that multiplies a number by all of the positive integers below it. It is denoted by the symbol n!, where n is a non-negative integer.

## Definition of Factorial:

The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 

### n!=n×(n−1)×(n−2)×⋯×3×2×1

## Special Cases:

1. 0!=1: By definition, the factorial of zero is equal to 1. This is a special case to ensure consistency in mathematical formulas, especially in combinatorics.
2. 1!=1: The factorial of 1 is also 1

Factorials become large very quickly, making them useful in fields like cryptography and complex computations, but also challenging to calculate for large numbers.

In summary,
The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n, and it has broad applications in mathematics, particularly in combinatorics, calculus, and probability theory.
